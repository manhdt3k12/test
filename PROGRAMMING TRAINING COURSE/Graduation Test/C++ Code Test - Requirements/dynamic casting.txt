What is dynamic casting in C++?
A cast is an operator that forces one data type to be converted into another data type. 
In C++, dynamic casting is, primarily, used to safely downcast; i.e., cast a base class pointer (or reference) to a 
derived class pointer (or reference). It can also be used for upcasting; i.e., casting a derived class pointer (or reference) 
to a base class pointer (or reference).
Dynamic casting checks consistency at runtime; hence, it is slower than static cast.
Take a look at the function signature of the dynamic cast below:
new_type *newPtr = dynamic_cast<new_type*>(Ptr);
