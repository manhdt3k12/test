C++ program to check whether a number is positive, negative or zero
Write a C++ program to check positive, negative or zero using simple if or if else. 
C++ program to input any number from user and check whether the given number is positive, 
negative or zero. Logic to check negative, positive or zero in C++ programming.

Example
Input
Input number: 23

Output
23 is positive

Logic to check positive, negative or zero
Logic of this program is simple if you know basic maths. Let us have a quick look about number properties.

A number is said negative if it is less than 0 i.e. num < 0.
A number is said positive if it is greater than 0 i.e. num > 0.
We will use the above logic inside if to check number for negative, positive or zero. Step by step 
descriptive logic to check negative, positive or zero.

Input a number from user in some variable say num.
Check if(num < 0), then number is negative.
Check if(num > 0), then number is positive.
Check if(num == 0), then number is zero.
Let us code solution of the program.
