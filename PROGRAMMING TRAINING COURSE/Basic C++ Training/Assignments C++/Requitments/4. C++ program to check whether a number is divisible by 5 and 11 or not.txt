Logic to check divisibility of a number
A number is exactly divisible by some other number if it gives 0 as remainder. 
To check if a number is exactly divisible by some number we need to test if it leaves 0 as remainder or not.

C++ supports a modulo operator %, that evaluates remainder on division of two operands. 
You can use this to check if a number is exactly divisible by some number or not. 
For example - if(8 % 2), if the given expression evaluates 0, then 8 is exactly divisible by 2.

Step by step descriptive logic to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.

Input a number from user. Store it in some variable say num.
To check divisibility with 5, check if(num % 5 == 0) then num is divisible by 5.
To check divisibility with 11, check if(num % 11 == 0) then num is divisible by 11.
Now combine the above two conditions using logical AND operator &&. To check divisibility 
with 5 and 11 both, check if((num % 5 == 0) && (num % 11 == 0)), then number is divisible by both 5 and 11.
Let us implement the logic.
