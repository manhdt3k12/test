Logic to find maximum between three numbers
In previous program we learned to find maximum between two numbers. That was pretty easy. In this program we will 
continue our discussion and we will write program to find maximum between three numbers.
Step by step descriptive logic to find maximum between three numbers.
Input three numbers from user. Store it in some variable say num1, num2 and num3.
Compare first two numbers i.e. num1 > num2. If the statement is true then num2 is surely not max value. 
Perform one more comparison between num1 with num3 i.e. if(num1 > num3), then num1 is max otherwise num3.
If the statement num1 > num2 is false. Which indicates that num1 is not max. Hence, this time compare num2 with num3. 
If the statement num2 > num3 is true then num2 is max otherwise num3.
