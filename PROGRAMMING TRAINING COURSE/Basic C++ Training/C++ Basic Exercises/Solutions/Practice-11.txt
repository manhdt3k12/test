Write a program in C++ to find the third angle of a triangle.
Sample Output:
Find the third angle of a triangle :
-----------------------------------------
Input the 1st angle of the triangle : 30
Input the 2nd angle of the triangle : 60
The 3rd of the triangle is : 90

>> Code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    float ang1, ang2, ang3;
    cout << "\n\n Find the third angle of a triangle :\n";
    cout << "-----------------------------------------\n";	
    cout<<" Input the 1st angle of the triangle : ";
    cin>>ang1;
    cout<<" Input the 2nd angle of the triangle : ";
    cin>>ang2;
    ang3=180-(ang1+ang2);
    cout << " The 3rd of the triangle is : " << ang3 << endl;
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
