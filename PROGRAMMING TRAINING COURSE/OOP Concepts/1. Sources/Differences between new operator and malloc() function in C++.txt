=> Differences between new operator and malloc() function in C++
- Both are used for same purpose, but still they have some differences, the differences are:
 -> new is an operator whereas malloc() is a library function.
 -> new allocates memory and calls constructor for object initialization. 
    But malloc() allocates memory and does not call constructor.
 -> Return type of new is exact data type while malloc() returns void*.
 -> new is faster than malloc() because an operator is always faster than a function.
