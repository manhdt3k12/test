/* A pure virtual function (or abstract function) in C++ is a virtual function for which we 
don’t have implementation, we only declare it. A pure virtual function is declared by 
assigning 0 in declaration. See the following example.*/
// An abstract class 
class Test 
{    
    // Data members of class 
public: 
    // Pure Virtual Function 
    virtual void show() = 0; 
    
   /* Other members */
};
