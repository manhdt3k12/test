/*
- Sometimes there is a requirement to modify one or more data members of class/struct
through const function even though you donâ€™t want the function to update other members
of class/struct.
- This task can be easily performed by using the mutable keyword.
- The keyword mutable is mainly used to allow a particular data member of const object
to be modified.
- When we declare a function as const, this pointer passed to function becomes const.
- Adding mutable to a variable allows a const pointer to change members.
