Storage Classes in C++
-----------------------
- Storage Classes are used to describe the features of a variable/function. 
- These features basically include the scope, visibility and life-time which 
help us to trace the existence of a particular variable during the runtime of a program. 
- To specify the storage class for a variable, the following syntax is to be followed:
- Syntax:
   storage_class var_data_type var_name; 
- C++ uses 5 storage classes, namely:
    1) auto
    2) register
    3) extern
    4) static
    5) mutable
