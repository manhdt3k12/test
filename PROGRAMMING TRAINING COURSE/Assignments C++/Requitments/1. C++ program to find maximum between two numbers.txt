Write a C++ program to find maximum between two numbers using if else. 
C program to input two numbers from user and find maximum between two 
numbers using if else. How to find maximum or minimum between two numbers 
using if else in C++ programming.

Example
Input
Input num1: 10
Input num2: 20
Output
Maximum = 20

Logic to find minimum or maximum between two numbers
Finding maximum in general is comparison of two numbers. 
In C++ programming we compare two quantities using relational operator. 
We use either > or < operator to compare two numbers (or other primitive types). 
Relational operator evaluates 1 (true) or 0 (false) depending on condition.

We can write expression to find maximum between num1 and num2 as num1 > num2. 
The expression num1 > num2 evaluate 1 if num1 is greater than num2, otherwise evaluates 0.

After finding maximum, we need to execute some action based on the maximum i.e. print the maximum number. 
In C++ if...else provides ability to execute an action based on condition. 
So we will make use of relational operator along with if...else to find maximum.

Below is step by step descriptive logic to find maximum.

Input two numbers from user. Store it in some variable say num1 and num2.
Check if(num1 > num2) then print num1 is maximum.
Check if(num2 > num1) then print num2 is maximum.
Check if(num1 == num2) then both the numbers are equal.
