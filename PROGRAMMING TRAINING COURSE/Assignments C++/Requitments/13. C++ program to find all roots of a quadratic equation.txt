Logic to find all roots of a quadratic equation
Based on the above formula let us write step by step descriptive logic to find roots of a quadratic equation.

Input coefficients of quadratic equation from user. Store it in some variable say a, b and c.
Find discriminant of the given equation, using formula discriminant = (b*b) - (4*a*c).

Compute roots based on the nature of discriminant.
If discriminant > 0 then,
root1 = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a) and
root2 = (-b - sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a).
Learn - Program to find square root of a number using sqrt() function.

If discriminant == 0 then, root1 = root2 = -b / (2*a).
Else if discriminant < 0 then, there are two distinct complex roots where
root1 = -b / (2*a) and root2 = -b / (2*a).
Imaginary part of the root is given by imaginary = sqrt(-discriminant) / (2*a).

After this much reading let us finally code the solution of this program.
