Wikipedia states leap year as a special year containing one extra day i.e. 
total 366 days in a year. A year is said to be leap year, if the year is exactly

Year is also a leap year if it is exactly divisible by 400.

Step by step descriptive logic to check leap year.
Input year from user. Store it in some variable say year.
If year is exactly divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, then it is leap year. 
Or if year is exactly divisible by 400 then it is leap year.
Let us now implement the logic in our program.
